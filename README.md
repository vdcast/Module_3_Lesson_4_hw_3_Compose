Internet. REST, Retrofit.

**Task:**

Create a search application for programmer employees through their GitHub profiles.

The results are shown as a list with logins, avatars.
When you select a specific programmer, his profile is shown.
And there is a button "List of repositories".
By clicking on it, a list of repositories drops out.
